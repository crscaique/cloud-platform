# cloud-platform :cloud:

Hey everyone :)

I am here to share my experience using two Cloud Platforms currently in the market: Amazon Web Services (AWS) & Microsoft Azure!
This page contains academic statements, technical procedures, and my opinion about cloud service providers.

What am I aiming for?
Cloud is here to stay. It is a complex and versatile environment which contains a world of functions that could only be achieved by building a physical (and expensive) structure back in the day.

Overall, in this evaluation, I have gone  through a few topics, such as:
- Cloud Concepts
- Introduction to Azure and AWS and an analysis of the user interface (User Portal)
- Elasticity and Scaling of services (Virtual Machine, Database and Storage)
- Deployment of Web Services
- And More...

The document is ideal for initial contact with the technology and exploring its tools and concepts. Have a look and have fun.

A few observations about...

1. Cloud Platforms Evaluation.pdf is a solo work. The piece of work analyses Microsoft and Amazon products. On top of that, my goal is to achieve a few key functionalities that can be applied in the professional environment, such as:

  • Development of a Web Service and the deployment 
  • Pricing of services
  • Type of subscriptions that the companies offer to customers and their benefits 
  • Practical and technical approach with screenshots of procedures, such as Elasticity and Scaling of multiple services (virtual machines, database, storage)
  • A comparison between the platform portal and the walkthrough for each service creation

2. Cloud Platforms Evaluation - Group Research.pdf is a group work. The credits have been given to the students who collaborated. Their names and identification can be found on the first page of the paper. 
This new piece of work goes deeply into the use of cloud tools, however focusing on:
  
  • Security and integrity of data - Use of cryptography and management of cryptographic keys
  • Use of virtual private networks and network protocols

3. Observations, notes and challenges.pptx is a brief presentation containing my conclusions through the process of using, understanding, and developing my research about Clouding Computing, have a look!
