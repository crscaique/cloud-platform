# cloud-platform

Hi everyone :)

I have uploaded a document containing my evaluation towards two Cloud Platforms that are currently in the market: Amazon Web Services (AWS) & Microsoft Azure!

What was I aiming for?
Cloud is here to stay. It is a complex and versatile environment which contains a world of functions that could only be achieved by building a physical (and expensive) structure back in the day.

In this evaluation, I have gone  through a few topics, such as:
- Cloud Concepts
- Introduction to Azure and AWS and an analysis of the user interface (User Portal)
- Elasticity and Scaling of services (Virtual Machine, Database and Storage)
- Deployment of Web Services
- And More...

Document ideal for an initial contact with the technology and exploring its tools and concepts. Have a look and have fun.
